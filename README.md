## About The Project
My goal in Statistical Mechanics this semester is to reproduce the results of a paper where the direction of the arrow of time is determined via neural networks by the working difference and entropy.
To generate data for this experiment, I wrote the Ising model in 2D. Various launch configurations and iterations will serve as training material.
